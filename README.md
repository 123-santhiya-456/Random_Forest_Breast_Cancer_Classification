# Random Forest Classification on Breast Cancer Dataset

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Random Forest classification algorithm.

## Algorithm Used
Random Forest Classifier (Ensemble Learning)

## Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (scikit-learn)
- Samples: 569
- Features: 30
- Target classes: Malignant, Benign

## Steps Involved
1. Load the breast cancer dataset
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
3. Train the Random Forest classifier
4. Evaluate model performance

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python random_forest.py
Conclusion

The Random Forest classifier successfully identified malignant and benign tumors with high accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in medical data classification.
